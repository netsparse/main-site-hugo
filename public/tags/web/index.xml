      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been utilizing Jekyll for the past few months to build my website. Although it does a pretty good job at doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a look at Hugo and experimenting alongside it.
I was able to replicate my website on Hugo with a better looking theme and decided to take the leap. I went ahead and migrated my posts and basic items, making sure everything was nicely organized. And so far, it works pretty good!</description>
