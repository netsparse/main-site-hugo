      <description>In our previous post, we setup a Pi-hole DNS server to block ads on our local network.
Although the Pi-hole is awesome, unfortunately it only works on our local network, and thus we don&amp;rsquo;t get the same benefits of ad blocking when we leaving the network.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can setup NextDNS on your mobile or laptop devices for whenever you need ad blocking on the go.</description>

      <description>Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that blocks advertisements, trackers, and other unwanted content from being served to devices on your network.
It can be run on a Raspberry Pi or other hardware, but running it in a Docker container has some benefits, such as easier installation and management.
If you are also new to Docker, check out my previous post on how to get started with Docker.
A Bit of History The Pi-hole project was started by Jacob Salmela in 2014 as an open source alternative to AdTrap, which was a device that would block advertisements and tracking domains at the network level.</description>
