      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been utilizing Jekyll for the past few months now to build my website. Although it does a pretty good job at doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a look at Hugo and experimenting with it alongside it.
After I was able to replicate the website and setup a theme for it, I ended up migrating the entire site and the posts with it, making sure everything was nicely organized.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve archived the old site, I still host it with GitHub Pages and have otherwise changed the URL, you could still access it here.</description>
