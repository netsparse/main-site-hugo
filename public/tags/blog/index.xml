      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been utilizing Jekyll for the past few months to build my website. Although it does a pretty good job at doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a look at Hugo and experimenting alongside it.
I was able to replicate my website on Hugo with a better looking theme and decided to take the leap. I went ahead and migrated my posts and basic items, making sure everything was nicely organized. And so far, it works pretty good!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s been quite the journey figuring out the ins &amp;amp; outs of setting up a blog and writing posts in markdown.
So I figured I may as well write about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
