We use computers, smartphones, and other devices to store and access our personal and professional information.\nHowever, these devices are not immune to failures or accidents. In the event of a hard drive crash, theft, or other catastrophic event, having a backup of your data is critical.\nIn this post, we will discuss the importance of backups, the 3-2-1 method, and how to backup your Linux, Windows, and Mac machines so that you can rest assured that your data is safe.\nWhy Backups Are Important We’ve all heard the horror stories of data being deleted or being lost by ransomware. When it comes to preparing for data loss in my environment, there are a couple key strategies one could use that could minimize the impact of being severely affected by data loss.\nData loss can have devastating consequences. If you lose your personal photos, documents, or other files, you may not be able to recover them. If you lose your work files, it could result in a loss of productivity and revenue for your business.\nBackups provide a way to protect your data against any potential for loss in the future.\nMethods / Strategies 3-2-1 Backup Method The 3-2-1 backup method is a simple but effective strategy for protecting your data. It involves creating three copies of your data, storing it in two different formats, and keeping one copy off-site. Here is how it works:\nThree copies of your data: This means that you have three copies of your data in case one or two copies become inaccessible or corrupted. Two different storage types: This means that you store your data in two different types of storage media, such as a hard drive and a cloud-based storage service. This protects against the risk of both storage types failing at the same time. One copy stored offsite: This means that you store one copy of your data in an offsite location, such as a cloud-based storage service or a physical location away from your primary storage site. This protects against the risk of data loss due to a physical disaster or theft. Incremental Backups This backup method only backs up changes made since the last backup. This means that it takes less time and storage space than a full backup.\nDifferential Backups This backup method backs up all changes made since the last full backup. This means that it takes more time and storage space than an incremental backup but less than a full backup.\nContinuous Data Protection Method This backup method automatically backs up changes in real-time, ensuring that the most up-to-date data is always backed up.\nCloud Backups This backup method stores your data on a remote server over the internet, providing an offsite backup solution that can be accessed from anywhere.\nLocal Backups This backup method involves backing up your data to a local storage device such as an external hard drive or USB drive.\nIt’s important to note that each backup method has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it’s essential to choose a backup method that suits your specific needs and circumstances.\nBasic Backup Guide For Your Machines How to Backup Your Windows Machine Windows is the most popular operating system used by consumers and businesses. Here are the steps to backup your Windows machine:\nConnect an external hard drive to your Windows machine. Click on the Start menu and type “backup and restore” in the search box. Click on “Backup and Restore (Windows 7)” and then click on “Set up backup.” Follow the prompts to select the files and folders you want to backup and choose your external hard drive as the backup destination. Click on “Save settings and run backup” to start the backup process. How to Backup Your Mac Machine Mac OS is a popular operating system used by many creative professionals. Here are the steps to backup your Mac machine:\nConnect an external hard drive to your Mac machine. Click on the Apple menu and select “System Preferences.” Click on “Time Machine.” Click on “Select Backup Disk” and choose your external hard drive as the backup destination. Click on “Back Up Now” to start the backup process. How to Backup Your Linux Machine Linux is a popular operating system used by many servers and developers.\nHere are some steps you can take to backup your Linux machine:\nConnect an external hard drive to your Linux machine. Open a terminal window and type the following command to create a backup of your entire system: 1 sudo tar cvpzf /backup.tar.gz --exclude=/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/dev --exclude=/sys / Wait for the backup process to complete. Copy the backup file to your external hard drive. You could also utilize a bash script if you wish, as mentioned in one of my previous articles.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 #!/bin/bash backup_dirs=(\"/etc\" \"/home\" \"/boot\") dest_dir=\"/backup\" backup_date=$(date +%b-%d-%y) echo \"Starting backup of: ${backup_dirs[@]}\" for i in \"${backup_dirs[@]}\"; do sudo tar -Pczf /tmp/$i-$backup_date.tar.gz $i if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo \"$i backup succeeded.\" else echo \"$i backup failed.\" fi done sudo mkdir -p $dest_dir sudo mv /tmp/*.gz $dest_dir echo \"Backup is done.\" Scheduling Make sure you have a backup schedule and keep your backup copies in a safe and secure location.\nTesting Your Backups In addition to backing up your data, it’s also important to test your backups regularly. This ensures that you can recover your data in case of a disaster. You can do this by restoring your backups to a different machine or location and checking if all the files are present and accessible. For a more realistic scenario, you could also simulate data loss and go through the process of recovering your data from there.\nMy Strategies for my Lab As of the writing of this post, I would say my current strategy is not a one size fits all approach, I try and mix some of these strategies together, but otherwise, you may do whatever works best for your environment.\nMonitoring I usually keep an eye for any SMART failures on my NAS’s RAID 1, I have alerts enabled through my NAS which alert me if SMART detects any potential failures with any of the drives.\nSynology Hyper Backup I keep incremental backups of some of the basic files from my SMB and NFS shares with Synology’s Hyper-Backup, and also utilize a cloud backup with Sync and pCloud as my providers.\nEncryption My uploaded backups are encrypted with Cryptomator and I only backup the most important data to the cloud, such as financial documents, identity documents, personal media like pictures or videos, notes, and other small sized data.\nLarge Media For all other large media, I try and take the 3-2-1 approach, but not fully. I have (1x) 12 TB external HDD, and (1x) 14 TB external HDD which keep an incremental and encrypted backup of all my other data.\nMulti Location Some drives are stored at my residence, I also have (1x) 2 TB drive with a copy of my encrypted cloud uploads that are updated every 3-6 months at another location that is not my residence.\nAlthough my approach is not perfect, I am constantly working my way towards adopting more of the best practices.\nConclusion In conclusion, backups are essential for protecting your data against loss. By following any of the above backup methods and regularly backing up your data, you can definitely make a difference, and ensure that your important files are safe and recoverable in case of a disaster.\nSo, don’t wait until it’s too late, start backing up your data today.\nLearn More 3-2-1 Strategy from Backblaze r/Datahoarder’s Backups Wiki List of Backup Software

This ensures that you can recover your data in case of a disaster. You can do this by restoring your backups to a different machine or location and checking if all the files are present and accessible. For a more realistic scenario, you could also simulate data loss and go through the process of recovering your data from there.</p><h2 id=my-strategies-for-my-lab>My Strategies for my Lab<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-strategies-for-my-lab>#</a></h2><p>As of the writing of this post, I would say my current strategy is not a one size fits all approach, I try and mix some of these strategies together, but otherwise, you may do whatever works best for your environment.</p><h4 id=monitoring>Monitoring<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#monitoring>#</a></h4><p>I usually keep an eye for any SMART failures on my NAS&rsquo;s RAID 1, I have alerts enabled through my NAS which alert me if SMART detects any potential failures with any of the drives.</p><h4 id=synology-hyper-backup>Synology Hyper Backup<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#synology-hyper-backup>#</a></h4><p>I keep incremental backups of some of the basic files from my SMB and NFS shares with Synology&rsquo;s Hyper-Backup, and also utilize a cloud backup with <a href>Sync</a> and <a href>pCloud</a> as my providers.</p><h4 id=encryption>Encryption<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#encryption>#</a></h4><p>My uploaded backups are encrypted with <a href>Cryptomator</a> and I only backup the most important data to the cloud, such as financial documents, identity documents, personal media like pictures or videos, notes, and other small sized data.</p><h4 id=large-media>Large Media<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#large-media>#</a></h4><p>For all other large media, I try and take the 3-2-1 approach, but not fully. I have (1x) 12 TB external HDD, and (1x) 14 TB external HDD which keep an incremental and encrypted backup of all my other data.</p><h4 id=multi-location>Multi Location<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#multi-location>#</a></h4><p>Some drives are stored at my residence, I also have (1x) 2 TB drive with a copy of my encrypted cloud uploads that are updated every 3-6 months at another location that is not my residence.</p><p>Although my approach is not perfect, I am constantly working my way towards adopting more of the best practices.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>In conclusion, backups are essential for protecting your data against loss. By following any of the above backup methods and regularly backing up your data, you can definitely make a difference, and ensure that your important files are safe and recoverable in case of a disaster.</p><p>So, don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late, start backing up your data today.</p><h3 id=learn-more>Learn More<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#learn-more>#</a></h3><ul><li><a href=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/>3-2-1 Strategy from Backblaze</a></li><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/wiki/backups/>r/Datahoarder&rsquo;s Backups Wiki</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_backup_software>List of Backup Software</a></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://netsparse.dev/tags/backups/>backups</a></li><li><a href=https://netsparse.dev/tags/guide/>guide</a></li><li><a href=https://netsparse.dev/tags/recovery/>recovery</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://netsparse.dev/posts/2023-03/seamless-file-sync/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Seamless File Sync Solution With Syncthing</span></a>
