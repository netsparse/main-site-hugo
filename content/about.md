I’ve had a huge interest in computers, the internet, building things, and learning, since I was a kid.

Having grown up with limited access to the web, I was always astounded by computers, what they could do, and also what we could do with them.

When I became older, and got my first personal laptop, a whole new world was introduced to me, and that was when I knew I wanted to take on the challenge of learning the magic behind the system.

### Background

I’ve worked in the IT industry since 2018, in positions ranging from Geek Squad Agent to Network Specialist for a large ISP.

In May 2022, I completed my Associates of Applied Science (AAS) in LAN Systems/Network Administration from Austin Community College.

Currently, I am pursuing the Cisco CCNA, along with Security+ and Linux+ certifications, with the goal of completing the CCNA by the end of 2023, and the other two by mid-2024.

I find that my strengths are in enterprise networking, virtualization, cybersecurity, and DevOps, with plenty more that I continue to learn everyday.

### Why?

I started this site to document my journey, and share what I’ve learned throughout school and on my own, with anyone that may also be pursuing a similar path (or is simply just a curious soul like me). As I’ve kept pushing through, I believe many of us eventually come to realize.. We never stop learning.

Normally, I’m accustomed to learning about networks and Linux, I’ve recently taken a dive into the world of web development, hosting websites and web apps. I’ve had a bit of experience using things like Docker to host services in my home lab, so this serves me as a potential learning opportunity to expand my existing skillsets and possibly be of help for people on that same journey.

### Hobbies

When I am not spinning up new virtual machines, fixing up my home lab, writing a blog post, or performing some kind of troubleshooting, you can usually find me outdoors hiking around the many trails in Austin, along with occasional kayaking, cruising in or around the city, and jamming out to some epic tunes.

Other hobbies of mine include playing the piano, guitar and ocassionally some drums, along with a multitude of other things.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime.

Thanks for checking out my site!
