I’ve had a huge interest in computers, the internet, building things, and learning, since I was a kid.

Having grown up with limited access to the web, I was always astounded by computers, what they could do, and also what we could do with them.

When I became older, and got my first personal laptop, a whole new world was introduced to me, and that was when I knew I wanted to take on the challenge of learning the magic behind the system.

### Background

I’ve worked in the IT industry since 2018, in positions ranging from Geek Squad Agent, Network Specialist for a large ISP, and now as a Sysadmin.

In May 2022, I completed my Associates of Applied Science (AAS) in LAN Systems/Network Administration from Austin Community College.

I find that my strengths are in enterprise networking, virtualization, cybersecurity, and DevOps, with plenty more I continue to learn everyday.

### Why?

I started this site to document my journey, and share what I’ve learned throughout school and on my own, with anyone that may also be pursuing a similar path. 

My hope is that I can help anyone out there in their journey, just as many have also helped me.

As I’ve continued pushing through, I believe we come to the realization that.. _We never stop learning_.

### Hobbies

When I am not spinning up new virtual machines, fixing up my home lab, writing a blog post, or performing some kind of troubleshooting, you can usually find me outdoors catching some air, longboarding, hiking, occasional kayaking, cruising in or around the city, and jamming out to some music.

Other hobbies of mine include playing the piano, guitar and occasionally some drums, along with a multitude of other things.

Feel free to [reach out to me anytime](/contact/).

Thanks for checking out my site!
