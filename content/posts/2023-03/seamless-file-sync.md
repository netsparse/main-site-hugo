[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a free, open-source file synchronization software that enables you to synchronize files between your devices securely. 

Unlike traditional cloud-based storage solutions, Syncthing is decentralized, meaning it uses peer-to-peer technology which allow you to sync files between devices without the need for traditional cloud-based storage solutions or SMB/NFS systems. 

In this article, we will explore how to get started with Syncthing and utilize it to sync some files with our devices.

## Getting Started

Syncthing is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, and can be downloaded [here](https://syncthing.net/downloads/).

You will need to extract the `.zip` file then install from there.

If you are on Android or iOS, you can visit the links below:

- [Android (Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)
- [iOS (via MÃ¶bius Sync)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobiussync/id1539203216?itsct=apps_box&itscg=30200)

**Note**: The iOS client is an unofficial client limited in functionality and features, but will work with files accessible through the `Files` app on iOS. It also limits you to 20MB of syncing before needing to purchase the 'Unlimited file sync' option. Keep this in mind when deciding to utilize it on iOS. For more info, refer to the [FAQ](https://www.mobiussync.com/faq/) and the [company](https://www.pickupinfinity.com) behind the development.

Once you have installed Syncthing, you should be able to access the dashboard by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8384`.

### Adding Devices

To add a device, you will need to share your `device ID` with the other device and enter the other device's ID. 

If you've setup the other device with Syncthing, you'll likely see the ID, you can then click to auto add the device.

Go to the `Sharing` tab, and select the `Folder` or folders you would like to share from the remote device.

### Adding Folders

To add a folder, click on the `Add Folder` button below the `Folders` section.

You can then select the folder you want to sync, give it an optional `Folder Label`, from there it will be added and show up on the left side of the dashboard.

Go to the `Sharing` tab, and select the `Folder` you just created. Similar to the picture from above.

Syncthing will automatically sync the files between them, ensuring that they are always up to date.

## Setting up Syncthing with Docker

[Docker](/posts/2023-02/get-started-with-docker) is a popular tool for managing and deploying applications in containers.

You can easily set up a containerized version of Syncthing for a server or central device you would like to store your files on. This is handy if you already implement a NAS system and utilize Docker. It could then be used in conjunction to sync with your other devices.

### Docker Run

```
docker pull syncthing/syncthing
```

```
docker run -p 8384:8384 -p 22000:22000/tcp -p 22000:22000/udp -p 21027:21027/udp \
    -v /wherever/st-sync:/var/syncthing \
    --hostname=my-syncthing \
    syncthing/syncthing:latest
```

### Docker Compose

You can also setup syncthing with a docker compose file that [they provide](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/README-Docker.md), make sure to modify your `env` variables for your `PUID` or `PGID`, as well as your `volumes`.

```yml
---
version: "3"
services:
  syncthing:
    image: syncthing/syncthing
    container_name: syncthing
    hostname: my-syncthing
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - /wherever/st-sync:/var/syncthing
    ports:
      - 8384:8384 # Web UI
      - 22000:22000/tcp # TCP file transfers
      - 22000:22000/udp # QUIC file transfers
      - 21027:21027/udp # Receive local discovery broadcasts
    restart: unless-stopped
```


You can then access Syncthing by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8384`.

From here, you can set up your devices and folders just as you would with a non-containerized version of Syncthing.

Make sure to follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html) on their website, which should include more detail on how the folders and syncing operates.

## Conclusion

Syncthing is a powerful tool for synchronizing files between devices securely. 

By setting up a Syncthing Docker container, you can easily deploy and manage Syncthing on your machine, making it easier to sync files between devices. 

With Docker, you can quickly spin up and tear down Syncthing containers as needed, making it a flexible and scalable solution for file synchronization.
