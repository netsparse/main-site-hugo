[Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) is a simple and open-source web application for managing Docker containers. It lets users easily deploy and manage Docker-based applications through a web interface, without needing to use the command-line tools. 

It supports various Docker environments and provides role-based access control, making it suitable for both individuals and organizations. Portainer is also highly extensible, allowing users to add more functionalities and integrate with other tools and platforms.

## Deployment

### Install Portainer Community Edition (CE)

First, create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

Then, download and install the Portainer Server container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

You can read more about the installation process on Portainer's [documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux).

## Accessing Portainer

Once you have installed Portainer, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `https://your-machine's-ip-address:9443` 

From there, you will be prompted to set up an admin account and select the environment you want to manage.

Once setup, you should see the main dashboard:

Portainer also provides a powerful monitoring tool that allows you to monitor the performance of your Docker containers in real-time. 

The monitoring tool provides detailed information on CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and more, allowing you to identify performance issues and optimize your containers for better performance.

To access the monitoring tool, simply click on a container in the Portainer interface and select the "Statistics" tab.
